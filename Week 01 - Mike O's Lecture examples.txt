Golden Rules:
* This is a programming course, the emphasis is on you doing lots of programming, exploring a wide range of problems, writing lots of code to ensure you understand all of the course topics, and keeping up with the work each week.
* The student study requirement for this course is 12 hours per week minimum: most of this time should be spent writing code to solve problems and explore the course topics.
* If you are struggling or fall behind, you may need to do a more than 12 hours per week.

Need help:
* Course forums for all tutorial question and course / topic related questions.
* Contact the CC directly if you need help on your assignment: Farzad Sanati, f.sanati@cqu.edu.au, Townsville
