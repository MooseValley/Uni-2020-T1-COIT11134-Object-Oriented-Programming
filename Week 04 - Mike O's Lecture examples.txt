Q.  I noticed when I made a 2nd gui which I opened inside my main gui. The exit_on_close would close both, how would you avoid that?

A. Mult-frame Java projects are sort of an advanced topic.
Avoid.
JFrame + TabbedPane or CardLayout pane


Q.  what is the use of null in g.drawImage(image, 0, 0, null); ?

g.drawImage(image, 0, 0, new ImageObserver() );



*** Lambda - Java 7+

JButton myButton = new JButton ("Calc");
::::

myButton.addActionListener (event -> calc() );
myButton.addActionListener (event -> calc() );
myButton.addActionListener (event -> calc() );
myButton.addActionListener (event -> saveToFile() );
myButton.addActionListener (event -> updateDisplay() );



Slide 21:
Replace all code with the new, simpler Lambda way:

JButton okButton = new JButton ("OK");
okButton.addActionListener (event -> performWhatever() );

private void performWhatever()
{
  // Code goes here ....
}


*** Slide 22:

exitButton.addActionListener (event -> System.exit (0) );

** Slide 23:

JButton yellowButton = new JButton ("Yellow");
yellowButton.addActionListener (event -> buttonPanel.setBackground (Color.YELLOW) );
buttonPanel.add (yellowButton);


Timer t = new Timer (1000, event -> updateTime() );
t.start();



*** Slide 26:  BorderLayout

import java.awt.*;


setLayout (new BorderLayout () );

// By default, JFrame has a BorderLayout.

	add (myButton, BorderLayout.NORTH);

	add (myPanel);
OR:
	add (myPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);


5 regions and each region can only contain 1 component.


	add (myButton1, BorderLayout.NORTH);
	add (myButton2, BorderLayout.NORTH);

==> All we will see is myButton2 - myButton1 is kicked out.




*** TextArea
multiple lines of text.

JTextArea myTextArea     = new JTextArea();
JScrollPane myScrollPane = new JScrollPane (myTextArea);

myScrollPane.setVerticalScrollBarPolicy (ScrollPaneConstants.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS);



*** Menus

Menus
Popup Menus

pasteItem.addActionListener (event -> pasteTextFromClipboard() );

private void pasteTextFromClipboard()
{
   ////
}


* Lamda code
* JSlider with labels and painted ticks
* Input dialog with combobox
* PopupMenus
* Anything else you want !!  :)

EOF.
