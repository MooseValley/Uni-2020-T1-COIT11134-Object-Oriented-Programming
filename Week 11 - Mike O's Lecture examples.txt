------------------------------------------------
*** Stacks
------------------------------------------------
LIFO - Last in, first out

A stack of paper, a pile of books
SQL
PHP
Java OOP
C++
Java prog


ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<String> ();
names.add ("Mike");
names.add ("Frankie");
::::
set, get, size()



Stack<String> namesStack = new Stack<String> ();

nameStack.push ("Mike");
nameStack.push ("Frankie");

String name = nameStack.pop(); // Frankie

peek ()



--------------------------------------------
*** QUEUE
--------------------------------------------
A little  different to Stack ... you cannot declare a Queue object
because Queue is an Interface class in Java.

Queue <Employee> myQueue = new Queue <Employee> (); // ERROR

FIFO
First in, first out


Super Market Queue
5 people in front of you ... those 5 people must be served before you are served.

Queue
	pop
	push
	peek
	size


	HEAD
Amy
Bob
Carl
Deedee
Emile
	TAIL

q.add ("Mike");

	HEAD
Amy
Bob
Carl				A
Deedee
Emile
Mike
	TAIL

	HEAD
Bob
Carl
Deedee			B
Emile
Mike
	TAIL

	HEAD

*** Slide 10
Incomplete CircularArrayQueue it should shuffle down data automatically, etc  it uses add() and remove() but doesn't implement these.


TODO
* Quad bike riding
* Jet Ski Riding
* Leaning more avout Java


10:04 - BREAK until 10:10 AM



*** TREE

Binary Tree
max 2 nodes per parent node

Balanced Trees

              50
             /
           20
          /  \
         7    45
          \

Stacks
Queues
Trees
Anything else ?
