// Copy Constructor

public class Employee
{
   private int id;
   private String name;
   private ArrayList<String> addresses;

   public Employee (Employee emp)
   {
	   // Dangerous: must return a copy of the data - NOT a reference to it.
      //id   = emp.id;
      //id   = emp.name;
      //addresses = emp.addresses; // WARNING !!!!!

	   // Safe: as long as the Accessor methods are returning copies
	   // not references to the original data.
      id   = emp.getId();
      name = emp.getName();
      addresses = emp.getAddresses();
   }
}


Employee emp  = new Employee ();
Employee emp1 = new Employee (3, "Mike");
Employee emp2 = new Employee (emp);


Assignment 1

* Typo ???  Maybe spec meant to say Parameterised Constructor ?
* Maybe Copy Constructor needed in Ass 2 ??


*** Copy Constructor Uses ???

What if ???  Analysis
* copy of employees, change their rates, etc
* see the results ?
* The original employee data is unchanged.
