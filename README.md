# COIT11134 - Object Oriented Programming (2020-T1)

All of my class work will be uploaded here.

This repo will include:
* all additional notes and examples presented during class,
* any partial or fully worked tutorial, textbook, etc questions,
* hints, tips, information ... given in class,
* etc.

### Golden Rule:
This is a programming course, the emphasis is on you doing lots of programming, exploring a wide range of problems, writing lots and lots of code, and keeping up with the work each week.
