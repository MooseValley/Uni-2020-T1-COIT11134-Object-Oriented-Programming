# COIT11134 - Object Oriented Programming (2020-T1)

All of my class work will be uploaded here.

This repo will include:
* all additional notes and examples presented during class,
* any partial or fully worked tutorial, textbook, etc questions during class,
* hints, tips, information ... given in class,
* etc.


### Golden Rules:
* This is a programming course, the emphasis is on you doing lots of programming, exploring a wide range of problems, writing lots of code to ensure you understand all of the course topics, and keeping up with the work each week.
* The student study requirement for this course is **12 hours per week minimum**: most of this time should be spent writing code to solve problems and explore the course topics.
* If you are struggling or fall behind, you may need to do a more than 12 hours per week.


### Need help:
* Course forums for all tutorial question and course / topic related questions.
* Contact the CC directly if you need help on your assignment: Farzad Sanati, f.sanati@cqu.edu.au, Townsville
