# COIT11134 - Object Oriented Programming (2020-T1)

All of my class work will be uploaded here.

This repo will include:
* all additional notes and examples presented during class,
* any partial or fully worked tutorial, textbook, etc questions during class,
* hints, tips, information ... given in class,
* etc.

### Golden Rule:
* This is a programming course, the emphasis is on you doing lots of programming, exploring a wide range of problems, writing lots of code to ensure you understand all of the course topics, and keeping up with the work each week.  The student study requirement for this course is **12 hours per week minimum**: the bulk of this should be spent writing code to solve problems and explore the course topics.
