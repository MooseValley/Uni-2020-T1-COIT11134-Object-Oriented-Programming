Suggestions:

* Keep a Java summary text file with snippets of useful code.  (Do this for all of your courses).

* Use a Adobe Acrobat on any CQUni PC (or any other machine with the licensed version) to merge all of the lecture slides, tutorial questions, extra readings, Java code, extra examples, course material, and anything else that may be useful into a single PDF - great for searching !!  A single simple search can find anything you need for that course.
